To isolate the performance issue, try commenting out line that calls addOrbitPoint:

In both CPU ZhuoranBoard.extendReferenceOrbit and GPU GpuZhuoranBoard.extendReferenceOrbit,
temporarily comment out:
  this.threading.addOrbitPoint(this.refIterations, re, im, getPoint);

If performance returns to ~2 seconds, then we know the threading computation is the bottleneck
and can optimize it further. If it's still slow, the issue is elsewhere.
